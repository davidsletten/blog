title: About David Sletten
---

My name is David Sletten. I've focused my professional efforts on building things for the web and over the last fifteen years have worked my way from graphic design through user experience, web development, and now software engineering. This evolution has played to my strengths in aesthetic composition and information architecture. This is the dichotomy that I feel really defines me, a juxtaposition between the chaos of art and the order of science.

My creative efforts have expanded to fill the gap left as my professional efforts have tipped ever farther toward the scientific end of my interests and abilities. For several years now I have dedicated myself daily to creative projects outside of work. I've written a science fiction novella, created an original campaign setting for D&D, and perfected a home-brewed hot sauce that I bottle myself and design the labels for.

I'm a new father and live with my family in North East Minneapolis, where we explore vegan cooking, tend our garden, play games with friends, and launch adventures into the wilderness of Northern Minnesota. This blog is a platform for me to share my work, creative projects, and adventures.
